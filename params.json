{"name":"Raspberry Pi Heartbeat","tagline":"Status webpage for Raspberry Pi server running Raspbian","body":"### Welcome Raspberry Pi Heartbeat\r\nThis is a small project for creating a nice, informative and easy to install status webpage for Raspberry Pi running Raspbian. Though it also can be used on other systems with a few tweaks.\r\n\r\n![Interface](http://i.imgur.com/aymzOMP.png)\r\n\r\nParts of this project were taken from: [Sysinfo Script] (http://derkev.in/rpisysinfoscript/)\r\n\r\nProject is actively updated! Stay tuned for additional features!\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nYou will have to check a few things for this page to show up correctly. You need to have:\r\n\r\n* Webserver (apache \\ lighttpd \\ ..) with PHP\r\n* Sqlite for PHP `$ sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite` \r\n* [PHP Safe Mode = off](http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/119/turning-off-php-safe-mode-on-your-server) \r\n* vnstat installed `$ sudo apt-get install vnstat`\r\n\r\nFirst 3 are more or less general and common. VNSTAT is additional app which collects traffic information. You might fiddle around with it's settings after the installation if you want. Main requirement is that it does give an output with this command `vnstat --dumpdb`.\r\n\r\n### Contents of the package & Installation\r\nAs for now: 4 files\r\n\r\n1. index.php - Home page which shows the graphs and info.\r\n2. style.css - Styles for the fashion!\r\n3. rpiTemp.db - SQLite db file. Empty but with tables.\r\n4. measuretemp.php - php script for cron job.\r\n\r\nTo set it up:\r\n\r\n1. Check and install if needed the prerequisites (see above)\r\n2. Download a zip from this page.\r\n3. Put it into a web server folder on your RPi (i.e. /var/www/ )\r\n4. Unzip.\r\n5. Setup a cron job as root\r\n`$ sudo crontab -e`\r\nand add a line at the end of the file:\r\n\r\n`*/5 * * * * php /var/www/measuretemp.php` - /var/www/ is the place where you've unziped the package!\r\n\r\nThis will run measuretemp.php every 5 minutes. If you want it to happen less often, change 5 to a higher number of minutes (*/10  for every 10 minutes, */35 for every 35 minutes and so on).\r\n\r\n**You are done! Access the webpage with the web browser.**\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFirst version by: @yuraa \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions \\ suggestions \\ feedbacks: rpih@yuraa.com - we hope you send us a note!:)\r\n\r\nAlso in case you want to join as a contributor - send a message to us.
